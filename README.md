# AUTHOR
AUTHOR is a system for creating multiple-format electronic documents from a simple text input. The simplest book can be created without special markup. For more complex books, such as those containing multiple images, additional markup is needed. In addition to the simple text input, the author eventually needs to add metadata to be embedded into the electronic products.
