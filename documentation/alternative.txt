A SIMPLE ALTERNATIVE TO AUTHOR

Frankly, this system is not for every content
creator. As noted before, one of the most
powerful features is handling large numbers
of images. In addition, the syntax of AUTHOR
makes it easy to insert hyperlinks, so making
an e-document fully interactive.

If you don't need a system this complex, I
recommend the following:

1) Create your book using LibreOffice. If you
   are only interested in the text, this is
   a very good (and cheap) product to use.
   
2) Install "Calibre" on your computer.

3) Import your LibreOffice file into
   Calibre
   
4) VERY CAREFULLY update the metadata
   information for your product, using
   Calibre. Select or create a good cover image.
   
5) Create your e-document, using the
   "convert books" feature of Calibre.
   
6) Carefully review your created e-documents
   in Calibre, using its viewers.
