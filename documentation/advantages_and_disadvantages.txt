Use of the AUTHOR system comes with both advantages and disadvantages.
Carefully study this information, before jumping in to a project.

ADVANTAGES
- - - - - - -

Simple input, using plain text, regardless of output format

Wide variety of e-doc output formats created, using well-established
   tools (Adobe FOP, Kindle "kindlegen", Calibre)

Limited number of markups (some projects may not need much markup at all)

Can handle large numbers of images (most "publish" systems choke
   on large numbers of images)
   
Easy to add hyperlinks to an e-document, so creating a fully
   interactive user experience
   
While not the official tool of choice, does a pretty good job of
   creating REVEAL.js web-based presentations.
   
NOT a WYSIWYG editor

Simple layout

Output doesn't look like a fully-designed, sophisticated layout, such
   that created by Microsoft Publisher (yes, that is an
   advantage to some readers)
   
Output is designed to work well with small screens (phones)
   and flow-specific reading documents, such as EPUB and
   Kindle



DISADVANTAGES
- - - - - - - -


Simple layout (yes, some people want 5 columns 
   across)

Does not support many sophisticated markups

NOT a WYSIWYG editor

Under "simple layout", note that this product does NOT flow
  text around images
  
Output doesn't look like a fully-designed, sophisticated layout, such
   that created by Microsoft Publisher
   
The Technical Editor who actually runs the product and produces
the e-documents, must have a decent knowledge of file management
and execution of programs on a computer. They also need to be able
to manipulate images, if the e-document uses them. They need to be
able to carefully edit JSON in a text editor, and in some cases, they may
even have to program in Java to achieve sophisticated layout results.
