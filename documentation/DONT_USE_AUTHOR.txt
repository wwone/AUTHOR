A SIMPLE ALTERNATIVE TO AUTHOR

Frankly, the AUTHOR system I've devised is not for every 
content creator. 

As noted before, one of the most
powerful features is handling large numbers
of images. In addition, the syntax of AUTHOR
makes it easy to insert hyperlinks, so making
an e-document fully interactive.

If you don't need a system with these features,
and don't want something this complex, I
recommend the following approach:

1) Create your book using LibreOffice. If you
   are only interested in the text, this is
   a very good (and cheap) product to use.
   
2) Install "Calibre" on your computer (free).

3) Import your completed LibreOffice text file into
   Calibre
   
4) VERY CAREFULLY update the metadata
   information for your product, using
   Calibre. Select or create a good cover image,
   and add to the metadata.
   
5) Create your e-document, using the
   "convert books" feature of Calibre.
   
6) Carefully review your created e-documents
   in Calibre, using its viewers.

7) Publish your e-documents
