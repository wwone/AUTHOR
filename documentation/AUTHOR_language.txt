The AUTHOR language is, in its basic form, simple. However,
adding particular formatting, requires special markup.

If you just wanted to write a book, just start typing.
Whenever you enter an empty "return" (empty line),
you make a new paragraph.

Only one line needs to be added to all that text
to make a book, article, etc.

There is a little more, in that you have to
ultimately supply "metadata" so that AUTHOR
can embed it in the final e-documents. It
is VITALLY important to include metadata
with any electronic document. If you don't, you
could lose copyright status, and your 
document could become an internet "orphan",
with no one knowing who wrote it, where it
came from, etc, etc.

SYNTAX

As noted, all text is simply typed in, using
a plain text editor ("gvim" is one example, but
there are many others). Empty lines indicate
a new paragraph.

MARKUP, however, is indicated by special
text in COLUMN 1 (very important!). The
markup is followed by a single colon (:).

COMMENTs, are lines that start in column
1 with the string "!:". The exclamation (!)
is the markup flag, the colon (:) indicates
that all the rest of the line is ignored, but could
contain lots of other things. For instance, if
you have an existing line you don't want, but
would like to keep around, just insert "!:"
at column 1, and voila, it is a comment.

TEXT MARKUP

If you want to add text in BOLDFACE, you place that
text in its own line, starting with "B:" in column 1.
If the previous line is non-empty, the bold text will
be concatenated with it. The following non-empty line
will be concatenated after the bold. Note that you
should check whitespace carefully, both before and
after the.
