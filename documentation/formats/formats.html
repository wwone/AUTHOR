Bob Swanson offers a number of his books  in electronic formats. Using these formats allows
these products to be offered at low cost to the general public, as well
as allowing readers of the books to have a copy that is fully portable
on modern electronic reading devices.
</p>
<p>
However, it can be a major challenge for the average computer,
phone, and tablet 
user to access and then view these electronic documents. This
web page attempts to help you navigate this complex subject.

          </p>
  <p >
Each format will be discussed individually. Hopefully you will be
able to follow the narrative and view the electronic documents
easily.
</p>
<p>
First, the declared format and/or the
file extension of a document file is VERY IMPORTANT. You need to
know what type of file you want to view, as well as what
equipment you have for viewing.
On most computer systems, the last 3-4 letters of
the filename (after a period character) indicate the
file type.
I will try to describe your actions for each file type,
including:
</p>
<p>
<a href="format_web.html">ZIP Archive Files</a> (books as "website-in-a-box" sets)
</p>
<p>
<a href="format_pdf.html">PDF: (Adobe Portable Document Format) Files</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="format_mobi.html">AZW3 or MOBI: Amazon Kindle (tm) Book Files</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="format_epub.html">EPUB: Standard Ebook Format Files</a>
</p>
