Bob Swanson offers his books
in several electronic formats. This web page describes how to
extract a stand-alone website book ("Website-in-a-box") from a ZIP archive.
</p>
<p>
File archiving is as old as the Internet. One of the earliest, and
longest-lived systems is called ZIP. One or more files are
enclosed in a single file, usually with compression to save
space and connect time.

          </p>
  <p >
When a number of web page components are stored
together in one archive, I call it a "website-in-a-box", a
configuration that makes it easy to view a particular multipart
document using <b>only</b> your web browser without connecting
to the internet. 
Examples of such book offerings include:
<br/><br/>
<a href="bluejacket_book.html"><i>Bluejacket Mail, A Postal History of the Great Lakes Naval Training Center in the First World War</i></a>
<br/><br/>
<a href="facilities2_book.html"><i>Domestic U. S. Military Facilities of the First  World War, 2nd Edition</i></a>
</p>
<p>

When you are dealing with a ZIP archive, you cannot
use the enclosed electronic document(s), unless you first extract all
the component
files from the ZIP archive. 
</p>
<p>
If you order such a book in  this format, you will receive
a ZIP file containing the book, or a link from which you can
download the book contents. Store this file on your computer
or phone/tablet.
</p>
<p>
Once downloaded, extracting the contents of ZIP files is 
very easy if you are using the Windows (tm) operating system.
Simply double-click on the ".zip" file that you just downloaded. Windows
versions after about "95" will automatically display the "Archive" contents
to you. Copy the files from the content list of the archive to a "clean" (empty)  working
directory (folder) on your computer, phone, or tablet.
 At that point, you can use the
enclosed file(s) and read the book. 

</p>
<p>
If you are not using Windows, you can still extract ZIP archive
contents. There is a very good free product called 7ZIP, which
has been released for a wide variety of phones, tablets, and computer 
systems. Download
and use that product (or App) to extract the ZIP contents.
You can get a free copy of 7ZIP from the website <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7ZIP Download</a>. Near the bottom of the web page
are listed the non-Windows systems for which you can get
a free copy of 7ZIP. Follow their installation instructions.
Use your App "store" on the phone or tablet to get the 7ZIP App for
your particular device.
</p>
<h4>Website-in-a-Box</h4>
<p>
How do you use the files ZIPed in a group ("website-in-a-box")?
Once you have extracted the files into a new, empty,
folder (directory) on your computer, phone, or tablet, the
book should be ready to read. To read the book,
make your web browser open the "index.html" file in that group of files just extracted.
(This is usually the "Open" menu selection.)
Your browser will then become the document "reader" as
you view the book you purchased. You do not need to
be connected to the internet, and you do not need any special
viewer tool, aside from your browser.
