Bob Swanson offers his books
in a number of electronic formats. This web page describes how to
view the EPUB files published.
The EPUB format is an international
standard. It is described on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">Wikipedia EPUB Discussion</a>. This reading format is used
by nearly all electronic readers EXCEPT Amazon Kindle (MOBI or AZW3). It
is the typical format read by the NOOK device.
<!-- An example could include:

<a href="http://www.militaryphs.org/articles/kent%5Fmatoika/kent_matoika_epub.zip">
David Kent's Princess Matoika Article</a>.
-->
</p>
<p>
At this point, you should have one
or more ".epub" files on your computer, phone, or tablet.
Generally, you received the file from a sales operation,
and/or downloaded it to your device.

          </p>
<h4>Import and Read EPUB File Using Google Books</h4>
<p>
The Google Play Books app is available on 
various phones and tablets. You can upload and
read EPUB-formatted books using this app.
See:
<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3097151?hl=en">
this article on uploading EPUB books into the Google Play Books app</a>.
In addition, Google Play Books is available on browsers using
a computer. Go to the link:
<a href="https://play.google.com/books">to upload and read EPUB books on the Google Play Books website</a>. You must have a Google account to use this service.
</p>
<h4>View EPUB File Using Firefox Web Browser and EPUB Reader Addon</h4>
<p>
If you use 
<a href="http://mozilla.org">
    the Firefox web browser</a> on
    your computer,
    you can read EPUB-formatted book files
    directly in your browser by using
    an "Addon" software package. See:
    <a href="https://www.epubread.com/en/">
        EPUB Reader Addon for Firefox Browser</a>.
</p>
<h4>Copy EPUB File to NOOK Device</h4>
<p>
Instructions for moving EPUB files from your
computer to the NOOK are located at <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-transfer-files-from-computer-to-nook-tablet.html">
article on the transfer of EPUB files from computer to NOOK</a>.
The instructions are similar to those for
the Kindle, in that you connect your device to your computer with the
USB cable that came with the device. 
</p>
<h3>Copy EPUB File to Computer, Tablet, or Phone with Reader Software</h3>

<p>
There are a large number of EPUB reader software packages
for computers, phones, and tablets.
</p>
<h5>Copy EPUB File to Android Phone with Reader Software</h5>
<p>
On the Android phone, you start an EPUB reader
program, and either "open" the EPUB file, or
"add to bookshelf". 
Note that you can read EPUB files using several Apps on
Android phones and tablets, including : "Moon+ Reader", 
"FBReader", "Cool Reader", "Aldiko", "Mantano Free Reader", and others. 
</p>
<h5>Copy EPUB File to Windows Computer</h5>
<p>
This <a href="http://www.nextofwindows.com/top-5-epub-reader-for-windows-7/">
article about various EPUB readers for Windows</a> contains useful
information. In particular, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html">Adobe Digital Editions</a> software for
Windows handles these EPUB files quite well. When you execute
the Digital Editions software, you simply use the "add to bookshelf"
option to insert your EPUB file into the reader.
</p>
<p>
Another EPUB viewer available on Windows and other
systems is embedded in a free document creator called 
<a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>.

This
document convert/creator comes installed with
viewers for all popular electronic publication types,
including a Kindle and EPUB viewer.
</p>
<h5>Copy EPUB File to Other Computer Systems</h5>
<p>
We have already mentioned 
<a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>.
This
free document convert/creator comes installed with
viewers for all popular electronic publication types,
including a Kindle and EPUB viewer.
</p>
<p>
I am not as familiar with the Apple iPhones
and iPads as I am with Windows and Android.
Check <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/25/transfer-mobi-epub-ebook-files-to-ipad/">this article on using MOBI and EPUB files on the iPhone and Ipad</a> for more
information.
</p>
<p>
There are several EPUB readers available on
Linux systems, including 
<a href="https://fbreader.org/">FBReader</a> (with versions
for Windows and MACOS, as well as
<a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>
(mentioned above).

<h4>EPUB File Issues</h4>
<p>
My experience with EPUB format is generally good. Most
of the readers can handle interactive content (where you
click on a link and move to a different part of the document).
For me, however, the chief drawback seems to be illustrations.
I am trying to create books where illustrations are key,
and which may require detailed viewing.
While the Kindle does a pretty good job of handling
images, the images in most EPUB readers seem to be fixed
in size, and with one exception, you cannot zoom into an 
illustration. Note that Calibre (mentioned
elsewhere on this page) is the one exception, allowing
separate viewing and zooming of images.
I believe that I can provide several other formats that do
a better job of displaying images in my books.
