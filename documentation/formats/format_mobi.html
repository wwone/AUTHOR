Bob Swanson offers his books in a number of 
electronic formats. This web page describes how to
view the Amazon Kindle (MOBI or AZW3) files.

</p>
<p>
By the time you get to this page, you should have one
or more ".mobi" or ".azw3" files on your computer, phone, or tablet.
Generally, you received the file from a sales operation,
and/or downloaded it to your device.

Note that the "AZW3" format is a newer type designed by
Amazon for Kindle readers. For your needs, it can be treated
in the same manner as the "MOBI" format. The names will
be used interchangeably in this writeup.
</p>
<p>
The MOBI and AZW3 formats were designed by Amazon, in order to
distribute electronic books.
Books published in this format contain a continuous flow
of text and images. Both the electronic reading devices, 
and software-based viewers 
of this format provide a wide variety of features to you,
the reader.

          </p>
  <p >
First of all, MOBI and AZW3 files are designed to be read
using the Kindle (tm) reading devices sold
by Amazon.
If you have such a device, there are specific  instructions
following that help you to load
 the book. If you do not
have one of the Kindle reading devices, this is <b>NO PROBLEM</b>,
because Amazon has provided free reading software and
apps that work on
a wide variety of computer, phones, and tablets.
Check the headings below for  instructions specific to
the software readers.</p>
<h4>Copy MOBI or AZW3 File to Kindle Device</h4>
<p>
Connect your Kindle device to your computer with the
USB cable that came with the device. You computer should
show the Kindle as an external disk drive. You will use
your File Explorer (Windows) to copy files. On other
computer systems, use the tool that copies files.
</p>
<p>
In the file explorer, you will see a directory on
the Kindle device called "documents". Simply copy
the MOBI or AZW3 file to that directory. When the copy is
done, disconnect the Kindle device from your
computer.
The next time you start up your Kindle, you will
see the book in your bookshelf.
</p>
<p>
Note that some Kindle devices will not accept
the book into the "documents" area. In that case, place
the file(s) into a directory called "Books". When you
click on a MOBI or AZW3 file located in that directory, the
Kindle reader will start, and you can read the book. It may
not, however, appear in your Bookshelf.
</p>
<h4>Copy MOBI or AZW3 File to Computer, Tablet, or Phone with Kindle Reader Software</h4>

<p>
Amazon provides free software-based programs (apps)
that let you read Kindle books. These programs and
apps are available on
a wide variety of computers, tablets, and phones.
 To use the MOBI
or AZW3 file you have, you will need
to copy that file into the working area set aside
for the Kindle Reader on your machine. Each is a little
different, unfortunately. We will try to describe all
that we know about, and we solicit users with other
system configurations to help provide more information
for this webpage.
</p>
<h4>Copy MOBI or AZW3 File to Android Phone with Kindle Reader Software</h4>
<p>
Be sure you have installed the Kindle Reader App on your
Android phone. You are going to find the Kindle directory
using a file manager. Most Android phones come with an App
for copying and moving files, we have had good experience
with the free App called "ES File Explorer".
</p>
<p>
 In your file manager, look for the file directory called:
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family: monospace;font-size: 120%;">Android/data/com.amazon.kindle/files/</span>
<br/><br/>
You will copy the MOBI or AZW3 file into this directory. Next time
you bring up the Kindle Reader App on your phone or tablet, the
book should appear in the Bookshelf.
</p>
<p>
Note that you can read MOBI and AZW3 files using other Apps on
Android phones and tablets, including : "Moon+ Reader", 
"FBReader", "Cool Reader", "Aldiko", "Mantano Free Reader", and others. 
</p>
<h4>Copy MOBI or AZW3 File to Windows Computer</h4>
<p>
NOTE: this method will <b>NOT</b> work with the Windows 8
(and later) Kindle App! You must download and run the 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc/download/">
"Kindle for PC" Installer</a>
program on your Windows computer, in order to read
3rd-party books, including those created by Bob
Swanson.
I repeat, the Kindle App in the "Windows Store" on
Windows 8 and later, will not
work with Bob Swanson's books, unless distributed
directly from Amazon.
</p>
<p>
Once installed, the Kindle For PC Program will set
up an area for book content. This area is
unique to your username. For instance, assume
that your username is "MYUSER" on your
Windows machine.
The MOBI or AZW3 files should be copied to
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family: monospace;font-size: 120%;">
Users\MYUSER\My Documents\My Kindle Content
</span>
<br/><br/>
When the Kindle Reader Program is started up
the next time, it should show the book content 
on the Bookshelf.
</p>
<p>
Note that you can install a free product called
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000765261">
"Kindle Previewer"</a> on your Windows machine. This
product is designed to allow authors to preview
their books on a program that appears the same
as an actual
Kindle device. On the other hand, it works as
a very acceptable Kindle book reader on Windows systems.
</p>
<p>
Another Kindle viewer available on Windows and other
systems is embedded in a free document creator called 
<a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>.

This
document convert/creator comes installed with
viewers for all popular electronic publication types,
including a Kindle and EPUB viewer.
</p>
<h4>Copy MOBI or AZW3 File to Other Computer Systems</h4>
<p>
Note that a working area is set up
by the Kindle Reader
on Apple MAC machines, similar to the
working area provided on Windows.  On the
MAC, look in the "Documents"
folder.
</p>
<p>
Another Kindle viewer available on non-Windows
systems
is a document creator called 
<a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>.
This
free document convert/creator comes installed with
viewers for all popular electronic publication types,
including a Kindle and EPUB viewer.
</p>
<p>
I am not as familiar with the Apple iPhones
and iPads as I am with Windows and Android.
Check <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/25/transfer-mobi-epub-ebook-files-to-ipad/">this article on using MOBI and EPUB files on the iPhone and Ipad</a> for more
information.
</p>
<p>
There are several MOBI and AZW3 readers available on
Linux systems, including 
<a href="https://fbreader.org/">FBReader</a> (also
available 
for Windows and MACOS), as well as
<a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>
(mentioned above).

</p>
<h4>Viewing Images with the Kindle Reader Program or App</h4>
<p>
One of the features of postal history books should
be illustrations of covers and postcards. When using most Kindle
readers, it is possible to view and "zoom in" on an
image. Check the "help" for your reader program or app.
