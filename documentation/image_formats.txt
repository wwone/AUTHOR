One of the powerful features of AUTHOR is the ability to
create an e-document with many images.

For instance, my WW I book is about 630 printed pages,
and contains nearly 1,000 images.There are few "publishing"
programs that can handle that many image.

There is a strategy associated with using images with
AUTHOR, partly caused by the limitations of the final
e-document formats.

One of the most important issues is file sizes. Think of
the storage and download time needed for an e-document
that contains 1,000 images....

What I have done is the following:

Images are resized to 500 pixels width. Images are stored
with a DPI of 144 pixels per inch.

This seems a bit harsh, given the desire of the
final audience (or the author) to want high-quality
images in the book. However, consider the final size
of a PDF file created with this many images.

The reason for the 144 DPI setting is the handling
of PDF output by Adobe FOP. If the DPI setting is
too low, the image placed in the final PDF will
be huge, and overflow the page size. If too high,
the image will appear quite small on the page.

Now, some print-on-demand (POD) companies, such as LuLu,
would like better DPI, but my experience has been
positive with these settings. Not so many years
ago, their printing equipment would choke and die
on images in the wrong format. If you create a book
with images using AUTHOR, be sure to get a draft
from your POD company, and be sure to preview the
print-format PDF on your screen, to be sure images
are acceptible.

This image format seems to work fine with Kindle and
EPUB as well. Most Kindle viewers allow you to zoom
in on an image. The detail isn't perfect with these
settings, but will meet most needs. (Recall that my
book projects have been with postal history. Collectors
of these historical items want to see some close
detail, such as a postal marking.)
