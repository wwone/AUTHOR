The "documentation" folder will contain various "how-to" writeups. Examples will include:

1) The AUTHOR language (what there is of it) [I will probably write this one
   in LibreOffice]

2) Javadoc for book creation code (maybe in the future)

3) "how-to" create e-documents from AUTHOR input, many of which will point
    to the "examples" folder

4) Use of JSON for metadata and "boilerplate" in AUTHOR

5) Format of images used with an AUTHOR e-document
