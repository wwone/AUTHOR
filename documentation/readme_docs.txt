The "documentation" folder will contain various "how-to" writeups. Examples will include:

1) The AUTHOR language (what there is of it) [I will probably write this one
   in LibreOffice]

2) Javadoc for book creation code (maybe in the future)

3) "how-to" create e-documents from AUTHOR input, many of which will point
    to the "examples" folder

4) Use of JSON for metadata and "boilerplate" in AUTHOR. This is a text
   document

5) Format of images used with an AUTHOR e-document. This document
   is in LibreOffice format
   
6) Document about "roles" and "flows" for using AUTHOR. Each
   role is described, and the interchange between the two
   roles is explained. The two roles are: (1) Content Creator
   and (2) Technical Editor. This document is in LibreOffice
   format.
