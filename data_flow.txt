This is a short writeup on how data flows through the AUTHOR system. A small amount of development history is included.

Originally, this software system was created to make two output formats: HTML and PDF. The PDF was created directly using
the Adobe PDFBox software package. This is great software, and I use it all the time for PDF manipulation. However,
direct PDF creation and layout is just too difficult. I changed over to Apace FOP instead.

As a result, the AUTHOR system reads text and creates text.

For PDF output, the system reads input and creates ".fo" files. These files are input to the
Apache FOP system. That system can easily create excellent PDF output. It does great layout, and
is very, very flexible.

PDF output can come in two flavors: interactive and print.

For PDF Print, the default layout is 2-column, 8 1/2 x 11 inch. It is pretty easy to manipulate the FOP
data to create other formats. In print format, there are page numbers, and all cross-references
("see also") are page numbers. All indexes refer to page numbers.

For PDF Interactive, the default layout is 1-column 8 1/2 x 11 inch. It is pretty easy to 
manipulate the FOP data to create other formats. In Interactive format, all cross-references
are clickable. Indexes are interactive, and stored as "bookmarks". Most PDF readers display
bookmarks for ease of navigation.

For PDF processing, you must install FOP on your computer. I will provide example scripts
that invoke it.

For HTML output, a single HTML file is created for the entire document. As designed, the
layout is dependent on use of certain CSS and Javascript. There is an alternative embedded
in the code, that uses "skeleton" CSS layout (no Javascript). It is not difficult to alter
the JSON configuration files to use another HTML layout scheme.
