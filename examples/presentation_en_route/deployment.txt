Once the AUTHOR program is executed correctly, there will be
a "reveal.html" file in the working directory. For purposes
of deploying this REVEAL.js web-based presentation, you
will need to have not only this HTML file, but also
the "utility.js" file. The directories "js", "css",
"pics", and "thumbs" directories must also be present with
the HTML. You may want to rename the "reveal.html"
file to match your project.

Once set up and tested, it is simple to combine all of these files
into a ZIP archive and send the presentation to
anyone, who can then view it with any browser that
supports REVEAL. In my experience, it works well
on computer screens (Win and Linux) with a variety of
browsers, phones (Android), and tablets (Android). This 
"website in a box" method of deployment can be much easier 
than trying to distribute an e-document that requires a specific
tool to read, such as PowerPoint, or even Kindle or PDF.
