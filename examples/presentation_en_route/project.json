"PROJECT_DESCRIPTION","This web page is a mini-presentation created by Bob Swanson, showcasing various 'en route' mail items from the First World War era, 1917-19 in the United States. Military men were moved by train throughout the US and a number of cards and letters survive, mailed onboard the trains. Many of the postal items show the handstamp of the Railway Post Office (RPO) clerks. RPO's were special cars on the trains that held mail and Post Office clerks who sorted and marked mail on the fly. This presentation is the property of its author, but is supplied to The Military Postal History Society (MPHS) for the benefit of its members and the general public for research and educational purposes. The MPHS is a non-profit organization for philatelists and stamp collectors interested in the collecting and studying of the postal aspects of all wars and military actions of all countries, including soldiers' campaign covers, naval mail, occupation and internment covers, patriotics, propaganda, V-mail, censorship and similar related material.",
