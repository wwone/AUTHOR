This folder will contain the full-quality images used
in the presentation. The current design places thumbnail
images in the web display, with the option for the user
to click on the smaller picture to see the larger
one.

As has been done with other examples, the actual
images are stored in the sub-directory "en_route".
This allows multiple documents to be managed
in the same file tree, with less of a chance
for filename collisions.
