An example of using AUTHOR to create a web-based
presentation. The output of AUTHOR is HTML that
uses the REVEAL.js system.

It is also possible to use the same AUTHOR input
to create the presentation content as interactive
PDF and print PDF. However, note that the format
and appearance of the PDF versions of the
presentation may not meet expectations.
It may be necessary to use a different 
AUTHOR input, or re-design some of the layout
to make the PDF appear more to your liking.

Note that to create the PDF (not needed for
REVEAL), you need the *.ttf (font) files from
the other example.

The good news, is that REVEAL is available
on GitHub:

https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#api

Once the output has been created by AUTHOR,
you will need to deploy the web-based presentation.
See the "deployment.txt" file for more 
information.
