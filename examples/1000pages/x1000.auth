Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.

B:historic Russian squadron's movement 
from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.

B:historic Russian squadron's movement 
from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.

B:historic Russian squadron's movement 
from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.

from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.

B:historic Russian squadron's movement 
from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.

from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.

B:historic Russian squadron's movement 
from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea.

from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.

B:historic Russian squadron's movement 
from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.

from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.

from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of

IN:Russia
P:Vladimir Berdichevsky focuses on the 
B:historic Russian squadron's movement 
from the Baltic Sea to the Far East 1904-1905 in the Spring issue of 
I:Rossica
, the journal of the Rossica Society of Russian Philately. The Russian fleet in the East was no match for Japan's. Ships from the Baltic were hastily repaired and overhauled and some vessels were sent around Africa's Cape of Good Hope while others went via the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Surviving mail and diaries of sailors detail the long journey. Letters and cards were sent via consulates in locations where the ships re-coaled. The long journey ended when the Japanese fleet attacked the Russians in the Tsushima Strait near Korea. The result was the sinking of two-thirds of the Russian fleet, the capture of six vessels, and the flight of others to neutral ports. The Treaty of Portsmouth (N.H.) ended the Russo-Japanese war.
