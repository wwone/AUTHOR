This is an example I created that shows how easy it is to create
a large e-document with this system. I created a file that
works out to be over 1,000 pages in length. I also have 1,000
images.

While the content is not all that interesting, the point to
note is how quickly the files are created by AUTHOR and the
helper programs. The printable PDF file is just over 1,000
pages, and only takes a few seconds to create. The interactive
PDF is closer to 2,000 pages. I was able to easily create
a Kindle file, and the EPUB created from there by Calibre
looks good and views quite quickly in the EPUB viewer I
use.

There is a Perl script here for creating the repeated
information in the AUTHOR input file. By altering the
parameters in this script and rerunning, you can
create contents for the AUTHOR file in any size you
wish.

Note that the first several lines in the "x1000.auth" file
are boilerplate and introductory material. Those must be
retained, if the repeated material is removed and replaced
by output of the Perl script.
