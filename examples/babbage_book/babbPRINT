# from the FOP input (made by AUTHOR), create
# a print PDF distribution file. This file should
# work with print-on-demand systems, such as lulu.com
#
# The working directory will contain the
# following:
#
# book*.foprint   FOP input files created by AUTHOR (they
#                 must be combined to make the print PDF
#                cat book*.foprint > babb_print.fo
# babb_print.fo  (FOP input after being combined from AUTHOR output)
#
# NEEDED? Arial*.ttf     (Arial fonts used for this example, any other
#                 may be used. However note that they will be 
#                 embedded. see the configuration file "fop99.xconf")
# NEEDED? Courier.ttf     (Courier font used for this example, any other
#                 may be used. However note that they will be

# following is the pathway to the installed FOP executable
# package from the Apache FOP site. The "fop" at the

# shell script. Per my testing, no other environment variables
# need to be set, besides those below. It is assumed that the
# "java" command will execute the runtime on this sytem.
