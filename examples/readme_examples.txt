Subfolders of "examples" will contain everything needed to make e-documents from the AUTHOR source.

The folder "article_lisbon" is one example set. It represents an article
published on a particular subject. Given the Java executable material
(JAR's and JSON files), it should be possible to use the contents
of the folder to create the output e-documents from the AUTHOR
source.
