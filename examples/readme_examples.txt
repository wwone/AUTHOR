Subfolders of "examples" will contain everything needed to make e-documents from the AUTHOR source.

The folder "article_lisbon" is one example set. It represents an article
published on a particular subject. Given the Java executable material
(JAR's and JSON files), it should be possible to use the contents
of the folder to create the output e-documents from the AUTHOR
source.

The folder "presentation_en_route" is another example set. It is a
presentation which AUTHOR converts to a REVEAL.js web page.
Thus, the user can have a PowerPoint-like presentation that
runs in the user's browser. The example also creates PDF
output files, but the format may not be of interest to the
user. (More work needed on PDF output of presentations)
