Subfolders of "examples" will contain everything needed to make e-documents from the AUTHOR source.

The folder "article_lisbon" is one example set. It represents an article
published on a particular subject. Given the Java executable material
(JAR's and JSON files), it should be possible to use the contents
of the folder to create the output e-documents from the AUTHOR
source.

The folder "presentation_en_route" is another example set. It is a
presentation which AUTHOR converts to a REVEAL.js web page.
Thus, the user can have a PowerPoint-like presentation that
runs in the user's browser. The example also creates PDF
output files, but the format may not be of interest to the
user. (More work needed on PDF output of presentations)

The "1000" directory contains the necessary files to create
a 1,000 page example of what AUTHOR can do. The input
file is padded to a size that creates a 1,000 page (or so)
PDF output. The other output formats have all been tested
as well. The example includes 1,000 images as well (repeated
from the same 10 JPG files...) The intention with this example
is to show how quickly a large document can be created.

The "babbage_book" is an attempt to show that a plain-text
book (taken originally from Gutenberg) can be quickly
converted into e-documents. Of course, a product like Calibre
can do this, but AUTHOR provides additional sophisticated
features like Indexes, Tables of Contents, as well as 
dynamic linking within the document.
