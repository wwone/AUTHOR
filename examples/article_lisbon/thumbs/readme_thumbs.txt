The sub-folder "fraser"  contains thumbnail versions of the images used
in the Article. These thumbnail images are used only
for the HTML output of the AUTHOR system. At this time,
they are not used anywhere else.

Note that the thumbnail images are NOT placed in this
the "thumbs" directory. They are in a sub-directory, in order
to allow multiple projects to share the same working
area.
