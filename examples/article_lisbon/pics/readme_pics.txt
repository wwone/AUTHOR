This folder contains a sub-folder with the full-quality images 
to be used in this article. The images should NOT be placed in
this ("pics") directory, but rather in the sub-directory
"fraser". This is done to allow multiple projects to share
the same working space.

Note, that for creation of PDF files, the images are limited to 500 
pixels wide.

When HTML created by AUTHOR is run in a browser, these
"pics" will be referenced as the full-size image.
When the PDF versions of this article are created,
these images are embedded in the PDF file.
Same applies to Kindle and EPUB output.
