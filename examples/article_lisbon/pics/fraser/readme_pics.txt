The images for the "fraser lisbon" article example should reside in this subdirectory.

Sub-directories of the "pics" and "thumbs" directories should be used, so as to allow
multiple projects to share the same working space.

The references to images and thumbs in the AUTHOR input file reflect the
presence of this sub-directory.
