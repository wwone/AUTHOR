This file will contains descriptions of how to make the actual
e-document output from AUTHOR. Note that HTML output will have
been created by the initial execution of the Java code.

The other outputs of this example will be:

1) Interactive FOP PDF  (run FOP per "createPDF.sh" script)

2) Print FOP PDF  (run FOP per "createPRINT.sh" script)

Follow directions in the two PDF example scripts above. Certain files
must be present in the working directory. The scripts are very
similar, the primary differences being the input files and
scripts used.

3) Kindle (run creation script from the "pics" folder)

4) EPUB (Use Calibre product to make conversion from AZW3 (Kindle)
    to EPUB
