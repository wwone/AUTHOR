This file will contains descriptions of how to make the actual
e-document output from AUTHOR. 


HTML
-----

Note that HTML output will have been created by the initial execution of 
the Java code. In particular the file "single_page.html" will contain
the entire e-document. To view it properly in a browser, you will, by default, 
need the "poem.css", "poem.js", and "utility.js" files in the
same directory as the HTML file. Naturally, if there are
any images, you will also need the appropriate "pics" and
"thumbs" directories in that directory. 

All of these files an be combined into a ZIP file for distribution of your 
e-document as a "website in a box", that can be sent to anyone, and read
by anyone with a browser.


PDF
----

The other outputs of this example will be:

1) Interactive FOP PDF  (run FOP per "createPDF.sh" script)

2) Print FOP PDF  (run FOP per "createPRINT.sh" script)

Follow directions in the two PDF example scripts above. Certain files
must be present in the working directory. The scripts are very
similar, the primary differences being the input files and
scripts used.

OTHER
------

3) Kindle (run creation script from the "pics" folder)

4) EPUB (Use Calibre product to make conversion from AZW3 (Kindle)
    to EPUB)
